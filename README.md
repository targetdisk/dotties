# DOTTIES
This is my personal dotfiles repository.  Welcome!

## Installing
### GNU/Linux and MinGW64/Msys2/Clang64
Install my dot files with:
```
$ make install
```

### BSD and Mac
Make sure you have the GNU Coreutils (for `ginstall`) and GNU Make (`gmake`)
installed from your ports tree.  On MacPorts and FreeBSD these are provided with
the `coreutils` and `gmake` ports/packages, respectively.

Once you've GNU-ified your system, you can install my dotties with:
```
$ gmake install
```
